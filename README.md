## Smarkets Popular Events Fetcher:

This project aims to demonstrate a simple react app that gathers data from the Smarkets API and displays event information based on upcoming popular events.

Bootstrapped using create-react-app version 1.5.2

## Setup:

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/jerminatorhits/smarkets-test.git`
2. Change directory into the folder using `cd smarkets-test`
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the server.
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

P.S. Top Events not showing up? The Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) must be disabled in order to work. I decided to use this chrome add-on available here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en
